/**
 * âœ… Bubble sort Algorithm -> sorting an array in ascending order.
 * The algorithm compares each element with the next one and swaps them if they are on wrong positions.
 * This process is repeated until the array is sorted.
 * @param {Array} arr - The that we want to sort.
 * @returns {Array} - The sorted array.
