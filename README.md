# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

 ## About repository 

 This **repository** serves as a **demonstration** of **data** **structures** and **algorithms** that are essential in the world of programming. The repository provides these structures and algorithms implemented in **JavaScript**. Each structure includes a **README.md** file that aims to describe the given data structure **clearly** and **comprehensibly**. The algorithms contain **clear comments** that make it easier to understand.

## Why should I learn DSA? ü§î

The **two** main **purposes** of DSA are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Solving complex problems** ‚Äì DSA helps us break down **complex** problems into **smaller**, more manageable **steps**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Coding interviews** ‚Äì If you want to get a good position in the **IT** world, DSA is a part of almost every **programming interview**, so it is important to know them.
