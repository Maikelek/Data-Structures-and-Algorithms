# **üìå Queue (FIFO) Using Linked List**  

## **üìö What is a Queue?** 

A **Queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** principle. This means that the **first** element **added** to the queue is the **first** one to be **removed**. Queues are commonly used in scheduling, buffering, and managing resources.

## üîç **Structure and Functionality**  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating and Managing a Queue**  

A queue can be implemented using a linked list where:

- The **front** of the queue represents the **first** element.
- The **rear** represents the **last** element.
- Each node contains:
- 1. **Data (element)**
- 2. **Pointer** to the next node

**Key methods:**

- **isEmpty()** ‚Äì Checks whether the queue is empty.

- **makeEmpty()** ‚Äì Removes all elements from the queue.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Insertion Operation**  

- **enqueue(x)** ‚Äì Inserts an element at the **rear** of the queue. This operation takes **O(1)** time.

How it works:

1. A **new** node is **created**.
2. **If** the queue is **empty**, **both front and rear** point to the **new** node.
3. **Otherwise**, the **new** node is linked to the **current** rear, and rear is updated.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deletion Operation**  

- **dequeue()** ‚Äì **Removes** an element from the **front** of the queue. This operation takes **O(1)** time.

How it works:
1. If the **queue** is **empty**, an **error** is thrown.
2. The **front** node is **removed**.
3. The **front** pointer moves to the **next** node.
4. If the queue **becomes** **empty**, rear is **set** to **null**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval Operations**  

- **frontElem()** ‚Äì Retrieves the **element** at the front **without** **removing** it.
- **frontAndDequeue()** ‚Äì **Retrieves** and **removes** the **front** element.

Both operations take **O(1)** time.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Printing the Queue**  

- **printQueue()** ‚Äì **Traverses** the queue and **prints** all elements.
- This operation takes **O(n)** time, where **n** is the **number** of elements in the **queue**.
